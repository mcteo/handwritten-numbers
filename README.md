# Handwritten Number Recogniser
> Tired of having to press those number keys on your keyboard? Well now with this super advanced neural network, you won't have to!

This is a simple Python implementation of a Multilayered Perceptron (with bias).

Trained with a random 80% of [this](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Semeion+Handwritten+Digit) data, for 20 epochs, it achieves < 10% error on unseen data (a.k.a. that other 20%), which is pretty cool (if I do say so myself :)).

You can see a demo of this [here](http://hope.ucd.ie/~mcteo/projects/numbers/).
